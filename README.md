### Bookmarks are boring

They're just glorified buttons at the top of your browser of choice. Not hugely exciting, but what if there was a solution, just something a little more unique and different? Well, meet Cardmarks, bookmarks but better! It's a simple little tool that runs in your browser where you can save websites, and go back to them later. Cardmarks automatically saves your cards in your browser's local storage so you can use them later.
Usage

### Usage

Simply press the + button to add a new website! At the moment it isn't very complicated, and I intend to keep its minimalist UI and feature set.
